    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This entire process included the above described data engineering techniques, as well as an extensive look at transforming variables, feature selection and elimination through trial and error. Different transformations on the price for example were attempted to normalize the distribution, but the decision was made to use the square root transformation as it lended itself to dealing with the upper and lower tails of the distribution of the price more efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the data cleaning process also included dropping or filling in of missing values, removal of outliers, one hot encoding categorical variables as well as dropping all variables that presented themselves with a high variance inflation factor. The use of QQplots and histograms were used to check the distribution of residuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Four assumptions\n",
    "The decisions of the creation of this model were based on the four assumptions with the method of justification, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity assumption: Scatterplots of the variables should represent some level of linearity aka correlation to the target variable. The use of scatterplots and correlation matrices were the method of justification for this assumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normality Assumption: Use of QQplots and Residual histograms were the method for justifying normality. \n",
    "The normality assumption in linear regression models refers to the assumption that the residuals (i.e., the difference between the observed and predicted values) are normally distributed. This assumption is important because many statistical tests and procedures used in linear regression models rely on the assumption of normality, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to check for normality of the residuals is by using a Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot). A Q-Q plot is a graphical tool that compares the distribution of the residuals to a normal distribution. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points in the Q-Q plot should follow a straight line. Any deviation from the straight line indicates that the residuals are not normally distributed. Specifically, if the points in the Q-Q plot deviate from the straight line in the tails of the distribution, it suggests that the residuals have heavier tails than a normal distribution. On the other hand, if the points in the Q-Q plot deviate from the straight line in the center of the distribution, it suggests that the residuals have a skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to check for normality of the residuals is by using a histogram. A histogram is a graph that shows the frequency distribution of the residuals. If the residuals are normally distributed, the histogram should have a bell-shaped curve, with the majority of the residuals near the mean and fewer residuals towards the tails of the distribution. Any deviation from the bell-shaped curve indicates that the residuals are not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: Durbin-Watson score close to 2 indicates that the errors are approximately normally distributed with constant variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Durbin-Watson score close to 2 generally indicates that the model's errors are approximately homoscedastic (i.e., the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the predictor variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because a score close to 2 suggests that the errors are approximately normally distributed with constant variance, which is a key assumption of many regression models. When the errors are homoscedastic, it means that the variability of the dependent variable is relatively constant across different levels of the independent variables, which allows for more accurate estimation of the coefficients and predictions of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multicollinearity: VIF scores for independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) are a measure used to assess the degree of multicollinearity in a multiple regression model. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other, which can make it difficult to interpret the individual effects of each variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final assessment and thoughts of the model\n",
    "- When plotted the model residuals show a normalized distribution, satisfying the normality assumption although with fairly long tails. This is something to be added into the future work. \n",
    "- The Durbin-Watson score is almost exactly 2, satisfying the assumption of homoscedasticity. \n",
    "- The linearity assumption was satisfied through a rigorous look at the plots and in general can be a difficult metric to validate. \n",
    "- The skew level of the data is well within the acceptable range of -2 to 2 which is a vast improvement from the original model which was originally above 10. \n",
    "- The kurtosis level is outside the acceptable range of -7 to 7 at a score of ~8.5, but however is still a major improvement from the original model. This is one that should be looked at later. \n",
    "- The Jarque Beras score is a massive 35770 which will require further investigation for future work. My instincts tell me there still may be some major outliers that may be affecting this score as the QQplots appear to be for the most part okay. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "`A positive coefficient indicates that as the corresponding independent variable increases, the square root of the price of the house also increases, while a negative coefficient indicates that as the corresponding independent variable increases, the square root of the price of the house decreases.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`In this model, we see that the most important variable in predicting the square root of house prices is the latitude of the house, with a coefficient of 100.368386. This suggests that houses located further north tend to have higher prices. The next most important variable is water proximity, with Water_Lake Sammamish variable having a very high coefficient of 75.729, suggesting that houses located near this lake tend to have much higher prices than other houses. On the other hand, the Water_Lake Washington variable has a negative coefficient, indicating that houses located near this lake tend to have lower prices than other houses.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Other important variables include the grade of the house, the square footage of the house above ground, and the condition of the house, all with coefficients greater than 20. The number of bathrooms, square footage of the basement, and the size of the view from the house are also important, with coefficients greater than 15.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`On the other hand, variables such as the square footage of the garage and the presence of a nuisance nearby have negative coefficients, indicating that houses with larger garages or located near nuisances tend to have lower prices. The year the house was built and the longitude of the house also have negative coefficients, suggesting that older houses and houses located further west tend to have lower prices.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Overall, these results suggest that there are many factors that contribute to the price of a house, and that location, house size and quality, and the presence of nearby amenities all play important roles in determining the square root of house prices.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of Zillows ability to choose inventory in the King County Real Estate Market, I recommend looking at properties that are near Lake Sammish or that are further north that also is accompanied with a waterfront. Since the grade, condition, and number of bathrooms appear positively correlated to the price it would make sense to try and buy older homes in the aforementioned areas as older homes tend to be cheaper in terms of price. Taking these homes and ensuring the grade and condition are of high quality through either pre-assessed purchases or renovations, along with possibly adding bathrooms can raise the price for resell value. Picking houses near school districts of high rating can have an impact as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Houses towards the west as well as ones that present nuisances clearly result in lower prices, so my recommendation would be to avoid buying houses that fit these parameters as it may result in \"holding the bag\" scenarios which could lead to longer times held with inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only invalid metric that should probably be ignored for now(but explored further) is the size of the garage negatively affecting the price. I would not consider this to be an accurate assessment, but I do not want to exclude it from the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions model can answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Should the house be on a waterfront?`\n",
    "- `How far north should the houses be?`\n",
    "- `What age should the house have?`\n",
    "- `What level of renovations need to be performed on the houses, and when?`\n",
    "- `Will the house price be affected by common nuisances? (eg. noise, construction, bugs)`\n",
    "- `How far west should the house be before one should lose interest of the purchase?`\n",
    "- `What average quality of schools in the surrounding area?`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future work, it is worth revisiting the value of the homes on the remaining waterfronts and seeing if there is any statistical significance. More exploration is needed but was not ready to be presented at this time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The views that are highlighted in the column_names.md documentation can be explored and onehotencoded and could be a potential candidate feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jarque Beras score and outliers of the dataset should be further explored. The use of 3 standard deviations from the mean being the metric for outliers could be expanded slightly as it appears this was still affected in a major way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any independent variables that presented with a Variance Inflation factor above 5 should be looked at again to see if multicollinearity is an issue with these particular variables. \n"
