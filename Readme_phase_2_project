Business Problem:
Stakeholder: Real Estate Agency - Zillow

Problem: A business problem you could focus on for this stakeholder is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

Description of the Data:
King County House Sales dataset
columns can be referred to in readme.



Possible variables of interest in project:

Based on correlation coefficient:
- 'sqft_living'
- 'sqft_above'
- 'bathrooms'
- 'sqft_patio'
- 'bedrooms'
- 'sqft_garage'

These categories are interesting because they are both continuous and integer values that 

Possible interesting string categorical variables:
- 'grade'
- 'condition'
- 'yr_built'
- 'address'


Plan for building stats model:
- Narrow down variables to 3-5 selections(also known as FEATURES)
- One hot encode any categorical variables for plotting purposes
- be prepared to remove certain "dummies" from the dataset to optimize one hot encoding. 

Process for "narrowing":
- Look at:
    - Scatter plots
    - histograms
    - correlation coefficients
- Try transforming the data via linear, logarithmic or polynomial transformation to see how shape of data changes. 
- Interactions will be used as a tool for exploring possible relevant correlations between certain features and the the target variable. 

Model will be created using a multiple linear regression approach. 
params - aka coefficients, p-values and r- and adjusted r-squared will be considered in the evaluation of the model.
